## Description
The file data.csv contains an artificially generated dataset that consists of 400 samples with 10 sensor readings available for each sample. The samples are divided into two classes where the class label is either 1 or -1.

The R script ranks and selects the most important variables based on their predictive power in logistic regression and random forest models.
